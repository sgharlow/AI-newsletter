# AI Prod Weekly — Issue #21

**Subject Line:** How I delegate effectively without a team (the AI playbook)

---

Hey,

Last week I shared my weekly review system.

This week: how I delegate without actually having anyone to delegate to.

Sounds impossible. Isn't.

The secret: AI isn't just a productivity tool. It's a delegation partner.

But most people delegate wrong. They treat AI like a junior employee who needs micromanaging.

That approach fails.

Here's what works instead.

---

## 1. THE DELEGATION PROBLEM

Solo consultants and small teams face a paradox:

- Too much work for one person
- Not enough work (or budget) for a full team
- Every hire is a major commitment
- Every task you keep slows you down

Traditional advice: "Just hire help."

Reality: Hiring is expensive, risky, and slow.

The alternative: Delegate to AI first.

Not everything. Not blindly. But strategically.

## 2. THE DELEGATION FRAMEWORK

I use a 4-quadrant model:

```
            High Judgment
                 |
    NEVER AI     |    AI-ASSISTED
    (Client      |    (Strategy,
    relationships)    decisions)
                 |
-----------------+------------------
                 |
    ALWAYS AI    |    AI FIRST,
    (Repetitive, |    THEN REVIEW
    templated)   |    (Creative,
                 |    moderate risk)
                 |
            Low Judgment
```

**Quadrant 1: Always AI (Low judgment, low stakes)**
- Status updates
- Calendar prep
- Data formatting
- Research compilation

**Quadrant 2: AI First, Then Review (Low judgment, higher stakes)**
- First drafts
- Email responses
- Report generation
- Content creation

**Quadrant 3: AI-Assisted (High judgment, variable stakes)**
- Strategy recommendations
- Decision frameworks
- Analysis summaries
- Option generation

**Quadrant 4: Never AI (High judgment, high stakes)**
- Client relationships
- Difficult conversations
- Creative vision
- Ethical decisions

The mistake: Treating everything like Quadrant 4.
The opportunity: Moving more tasks to Quadrants 1-3.

## 3. THE DELEGATION WORKFLOW

For every task, I run this process:

### Step 1: Capture the task

```
I need to: [describe task]

Current approach:
- How long it takes: [X minutes/hours]
- How often I do it: [frequency]
- Quality required: [low/medium/high]
- Stakes if wrong: [low/medium/high]
```

### Step 2: Assess delegation potential

```
Evaluate this task for AI delegation:

Task: [paste description]
Time: [X]
Frequency: [X]
Quality: [X]
Stakes: [X]

Questions:
1. Can this be templated? (Yes/No/Partially)
2. Does this require real-time information? (Yes/No)
3. Does this require relationship context? (Yes/No)
4. Is the output format consistent? (Yes/No)
5. Would 80% quality be acceptable? (Yes/No)

Recommend:
- Always AI
- AI First, Review
- AI Assisted
- Never AI

Explain your reasoning.
```

### Step 3: Create the delegation recipe

For "Always AI" tasks:

```
Create a complete delegation recipe for:

Task: [describe]
Inputs I'll provide: [list]
Output I need: [format]
Quality bar: [standards]

The recipe should:
1. Be fully automated (no review needed)
2. Handle common edge cases
3. Flag unusual situations for my attention
4. Output in my preferred format
```

For "AI First, Review" tasks:

```
Create a delegation recipe for:

Task: [describe]
Draft standard: [what good looks like]
My review focus: [what I need to check]

The recipe should:
1. Generate a complete first draft
2. Highlight decisions I need to make
3. Flag low-confidence sections
4. Estimate my review time
```

## 4. REAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Client Status Updates (Always AI)

**Before:** 30 minutes per client, weekly. 5 clients = 2.5 hours.

**Delegation recipe:**

```
Generate weekly status update for [CLIENT]:

Inputs:
- Tasks completed this week: [list]
- Tasks in progress: [list]
- Blockers: [list]
- Hours logged: [number]

Output format:
1. Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Completed items (bullet list)
3. In progress (bullet list with % complete)
4. Next week priorities (bullet list)
5. Blockers/needs (if any)

Tone: Professional, concise, forward-looking
Length: Under 200 words
```

**After:** 3 minutes per client. 15 minutes total. Zero review needed.

### Example 2: Proposal First Drafts (AI First, Review)

**Before:** 3 hours per proposal.

**Delegation recipe:**

```
Generate proposal draft for:

Prospect: [name]
Company: [company]
Problem discussed: [summary]
Proposed solution: [approach]
Budget range: [if known]

Include:
1. Executive summary (50 words)
2. Problem statement (their words)
3. Proposed approach (3-5 phases)
4. Timeline estimate
5. Investment options (3 tiers if applicable)
6. Why us (3 differentiators)
7. Next steps

Highlight sections needing my input.
Flag any assumptions made.
```

**After:** 45 minutes total (15 min AI, 30 min review/customize).

### Example 3: Research Synthesis (AI Assisted)

**Before:** 4 hours of reading, 2 hours of synthesis.

**Delegation recipe:**

```
Synthesize research on [TOPIC]:

Sources to analyze: [paste or link]

I need to understand:
1. Key findings (bullet list)
2. Conflicting viewpoints (if any)
3. Gaps in the research
4. Implications for [my context]
5. Recommended next steps

Format as executive brief.
Include source citations.
Highlight anything surprising.
```

**After:** 1 hour (30 min AI synthesis, 30 min my analysis).

## 5. THE REVIEW CALIBRATION

The hardest part of delegation: knowing when to review.

Over-review: Wastes time, defeats the purpose.
Under-review: Quality suffers, errors slip through.

**My calibration process:**

Week 1: Review everything at 100%.
Week 2: Review 75%, spot-check 25%.
Week 3: Review 50%, spot-check 50%.
Week 4: Review only flagged items.

If errors increase, step back up.
If quality stays high, maintain.

**The trust ladder:**

```
After [X] successful uses without issues:

0-10 uses: Full review
11-25 uses: Spot check
26-50 uses: Review flagged only
50+ uses: Trust fully
```

Track your delegation recipes separately.
Know which ones you can trust.

## 6. COMMON DELEGATION MISTAKES

**Mistake #1: Over-specifying**

Bad: "Write exactly 147 words in active voice with 3 sentences per paragraph..."

Good: "Write a concise email (under 200 words) that sounds like me."

Specificity should match importance.

**Mistake #2: No feedback loop**

If you never tell the AI what worked and what didn't, it can't improve.

After each use:
- What was good?
- What needs adjustment?
- What's missing?

**Mistake #3: Delegating relationship tasks**

AI can draft the email.
AI shouldn't decide if you should send it.

Judgment about people stays with you.

**Mistake #4: Treating AI like a human hire**

Humans need context gradually.
AI needs context immediately.

Front-load the context.
Don't assume it knows your preferences.

## 7. THE DELEGATION DASHBOARD

I track my delegated tasks:

| Task | Quadrant | Weekly Time (Before) | Weekly Time (After) | Trust Level |
|------|----------|---------------------|--------------------|----|
| Status updates | Always | 2.5 hrs | 0.25 hrs | Full |
| Email responses | AI First | 3 hrs | 1 hr | High |
| Research | Assisted | 6 hrs | 2 hrs | Medium |
| Proposals | AI First | 3 hrs | 0.75 hrs | High |

Total weekly savings: 10.5 hours.

That's an extra day per week.

Not from working faster.
From delegating smarter.

---

## THIS WEEK'S ACTION

Pick one task you do every week.

Run this quick assessment:

```
Task: [describe in one sentence]
Time: [how long it takes]
Frequency: [how often]
Stakes: [what happens if it's wrong]

Could AI handle this with:
- No review?
- Quick review?
- Heavy assistance?

If yes, write a one-paragraph delegation recipe.
Try it this week.
Track the results.
```

Start with one task.
Prove it works.
Add another.

## ONE AUTOMATION TO STEAL

**The Delegation Decision Helper:**

**Trigger:** New task added to your task manager

**Workflow:**
1. Extract task description
2. Match against your quadrant criteria
3. Suggest delegation approach
4. If "Always AI" — auto-generate the recipe
5. If "AI First" — draft the recipe for your review
6. If "Assisted" — add to your "needs judgment" list
7. If "Never AI" — add to your personal queue

**Your role:** Review the suggestions, approve the recipes.

**Time saved:** 30 seconds per task decision. 100 tasks/week = 50 minutes.

## WHAT'S NEXT

Next week: "The Context Window Strategy" — How I structure prompts to maximize Claude's understanding (and minimize re-explaining).

Until then, may your delegations be smooth and your reviews be quick.

Cheers,
AI Prod Weekly

P.S. The math again: 10 hours saved per week = 520 hours per year = 65 full work days. That's 13 weeks. A quarter of your year, reclaimed.

P.P.S. What task are you delegating first? Reply and tell me — I'll help you draft the recipe.
