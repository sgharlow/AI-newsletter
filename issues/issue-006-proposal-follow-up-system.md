# AI Prod Weekly — Issue #6

**Subject Line:** The proposal follow-up that doesn't make you cringe

---

Hey,

You sent the proposal Tuesday. It's now Friday. Radio silence.

Do you:
A) Send "Just checking in on that proposal..." (cringe)
B) Wait another week hoping they'll respond (anxiety)
C) Assume they're not interested and move on (maybe premature)

None of these feel great. But there's a fourth option: a follow-up system that's persistent without being pushy, and runs without you touching it.

## 1. AUTOMATION OF THE WEEK: The Proposal Follow-Up System

**The problem:** Proposal limbo. You've done the work to write a great proposal, and now you're stuck refreshing your inbox, wondering if they even opened it.

**The solution:** A timed sequence that follows up automatically, tracks engagement, and tells you when to move on.

**The sequence:**

```
Proposal sent
      ↓
 Day 3: Value reminder
      ↓
 Day 7: Objection handler
      ↓
 Day 14: Decision deadline
      ↓
 Day 21: Close the loop
```

**How to build it:**

**Step 1: Track the send**

When you send a proposal, add it to a simple tracker:
- Notion database
- Airtable base
- Even a Google Sheet works

Track: Client name, proposal amount, date sent, status (pending/won/lost).

**Step 2: Create the email sequence**

**Email 1 — Day 3 (Value Reminder)**

Subject: Re: Proposal for {{project_name}}

```
Hi {{client_first_name}},

Wanted to make sure you received the proposal I sent over on {{send_date}}.

One thing I didn't mention: {{specific_value_point}}. Given what you shared about {{their_pain_point}}, I think this could make a real difference.

Happy to jump on a quick call if you'd like to discuss any details.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Email 2 — Day 7 (Objection Handler)**

Subject: Quick question about the proposal

```
Hi {{client_first_name}},

I know proposals can sit in the "I'll get to it" pile—totally understand.

If there's anything holding you back (timing, budget, scope), I'd love to know. Sometimes we can adjust things to make it work.

Either way, just wanted to check in.

{{your_name}}
```

**Email 3 — Day 14 (Decision Deadline)**

Subject: Should I close this out?

```
Hi {{client_first_name}},

I want to be respectful of your time (and mine), so I'm checking in one more time on the {{project_name}} proposal.

If you'd like to move forward, I have availability starting {{available_date}}. If now isn't the right time, no worries at all—just let me know and I'll follow up in a few months.

Would love to hear either way.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Email 4 — Day 21 (Close the Loop)**

Subject: Closing the loop

```
Hi {{client_first_name}},

Since I haven't heard back, I'll assume the timing isn't right for {{project_name}} and will close out my follow-up on this.

If things change down the road, feel free to reach out—I'd be happy to revisit.

Thanks for considering me.

{{your_name}}
```

**Step 3: Stop the sequence on reply**

This is crucial. Use a tool that detects replies and stops the sequence automatically (most email tools do this). You don't want to send "Should I close this out?" right after they replied with questions.

**Time to implement:** 30 minutes
**Time saved:** 5-10 minutes per proposal (plus the mental overhead of remembering to follow up)

## 2. AI INSIGHT: The "Close the Loop" Email

Email 4 is the secret weapon.

Saying "I'll assume the timing isn't right" does two things:
1. It takes pressure off them to respond with a "no"
2. It often triggers a response because people feel slightly guilty about ghosting

I've had prospects reply to this email weeks later saying "Actually, let's do it."

The psychology: You're giving them an easy out, which paradoxically makes them more likely to engage. It's the opposite of chasing.

## 3. TOOL OF THE WEEK: Streak CRM (Free Tier)

**What it does:** CRM that lives inside Gmail. Track deals, set follow-up reminders, and see when emails are opened.

**Why it works for proposals:**
- See if they opened your proposal email (read receipts)
- Set automatic follow-up reminders
- Pipeline view shows all pending proposals at a glance
- Free for basic use

**Key feature:** "Snooze" an email to reappear at the top of your inbox on a specific date. Never forget to follow up again.

**Alternatives:**
- HubSpot CRM (free, more features, steeper learning curve)
- Pipedrive (paid, great pipeline visualization)
- Notion + calendar reminders (DIY approach)

---

## 4. QUICK WIN (Under 2 Minutes)

**Save your follow-up emails as templates.**

Right now:
1. Open your email app (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
2. Create a new template called "Proposal Follow-up Day 3"
3. Paste the Email 1 copy from above
4. Save

Now you can send the follow-up in 30 seconds instead of writing from scratch.

## 5. WHAT'S NEXT

Next week: **The New Client Onboarding Drip** — because winning the deal is only half the battle. We'll automate the first 30 days to set projects up for success.

See you Thursday,
Steve

P.S. What's your proposal close rate? I'm always curious how different industries compare. Reply and share—no judgment, just data.
