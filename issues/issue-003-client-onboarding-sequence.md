# The AI Reframe — Issue #3

**Subject Line:** The 7-day client onboarding sequence that runs itself

---

Hey,

New client signed. Now what?

If you're manually sending welcome emails, chasing for kickoff docs, and explaining your process every time—you're leaving hours on the table.

## 1. AUTOMATION OF THE WEEK: The Automated Client Onboarding Sequence

**The problem:** First impressions matter. But when you're juggling 4 clients, onboarding gets sloppy. Welcome emails go out late. Kickoff docs arrive the morning of the call. Not professional.

**The solution:** A 7-day email sequence that triggers automatically when a client signs. Zero manual work after the initial setup.

**The sequence:**

| Day | Email | Purpose |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | Welcome + What to Expect | Set the tone, explain your process |
| 1 | Intake Form | Collect info you need for kickoff |
| 3 | Kickoff Prep | Agenda, what to prepare, logistics |
| 5 | Resource Drop | Share relevant templates, guides, tools |
| 7 | Check-in | "Any questions before we dive in?" |

**How to build it:**

**Tools needed:** Email tool (ConvertKit, Mailchimp, or Buttondown) + form (Tally, Typeform) + trigger

**Step 1:** Create the 5 emails above. Keep them short (under 150 words each). Personalize with `{{first_name}}` and `{{company}}` tags.

**Step 2:** Set up your intake form with fields:
- Primary contact name/email
- Project goals (1-2 sentences)
- Key stakeholders
- Preferred communication channel
- Any hard deadlines

**Step 3:** Create the trigger. Options:
- **Stripe webhook** → new payment → add to sequence
- **Calendly** → kickoff booked → add to sequence
- **Manual** → add email to ConvertKit tag

**Step 4:** Test with your own email. Verify timing, links, personalization.

**Time to implement:** 45-60 minutes (one-time)
**Time saved:** 30-45 minutes per client + better first impression

## 2. AI INSIGHT: Automate the Repeatable, Personalize the Unique

Not everything should be automated. Use this filter:

**Automate:**
- Process explanations (they're the same every time)
- Document requests (intake forms, NDAs)
- Scheduling logistics
- Reminder sequences

**Keep manual:**
- Kickoff call (this is relationship-building)
- Custom strategy (that's what they're paying for)
- Sensitive conversations

The goal isn't to remove yourself. It's to remove the repetitive parts so you show up fresh for the important ones.

## 3. TOOL OF THE WEEK: Tally (Free Form Builder)

**What it does:** Beautiful forms, unlimited responses, free tier that actually works.

**Why I use it for client intake:**
- No ugly Typeform branding
- Logic jumps (show different questions based on answers)
- Integrates with Notion, Airtable, Zapier
- Seriously—free. No catch.

**Pro tip:** Add a "Anything else I should know?" open field at the end. Clients reveal important context they wouldn't think to mention otherwise.

## 4. QUICK WIN (Under 2 Minutes)

**Create a "Working With Me" doc and link it in your welcome email:**

Contents:
- Response time expectations
- Best way to reach you (Slack? Email?)
- How you handle scope changes
- Meeting preferences (async vs. sync)

One page. Prevents 80% of "how do you prefer to..." questions.
