# AI Prod Weekly — Welcome Issue

**Subject Line:** Welcome to AI Prod Weekly (+ your first quick win)

---

Hey,

Thanks for subscribing to AI Prod Weekly. I'm Steve, and I created this newsletter for one reason: **I was tired of wasting time on work that could be automated.**

As a consultant, I spent years doing the same repetitive tasks—sorting emails, chasing follow-ups, formatting reports. Sound familiar?

Then I started building small automations. Not complex systems. Just simple, practical workflows that save 15 minutes here, an hour there. Those add up fast.

**This newsletter is what I wish existed when I started.**

## What to Expect

Every Thursday, you'll get:

1. **One Automation** — A step-by-step workflow you can build in 15-30 minutes
2. **One Insight** — A principle or mental model that makes AI tools more useful
3. **One Tool** — Something I'm actually using, not sponsored fluff

No theory. No hype. Just practical stuff you can implement the same day.

## Your First Quick Win (2 Minutes)

Let's start with something you can do right now.

**The Problem:** You check email constantly because you're afraid of missing something urgent.

**The Fix:** Create a VIP filter in Gmail that notifies you only for emails that matter.

**Here's how:**

1. Open Gmail Settings (gear icon) > "See all settings" > "Filters and Blocked Addresses"
2. Click "Create a new filter"
3. In the "From" field, enter your top 5 clients/contacts separated by OR:
   ```
   john@clienta.com OR sarah@clientb.com OR mike@bigdeal.com
   ```
4. Click "Create filter"
5. Check "Star it" and "Always mark as important"
6. Save

**Now turn off Gmail notifications entirely.** Check email 2-3 times a day instead. Starred emails from your VIPs will always be at the top.

**Time to set up:** 2 minutes
**Time saved:** Reclaim hours of scattered attention each week

## Coming Up

Here's what's in the pipeline:

- **Issue #1:** AI-powered Gmail triage (auto-sort every email into 4 categories)
- **Issue #2:** Meeting notes to action items (never forget a follow-up again)
- **Issue #3:** Client onboarding sequences (automate the first 7 days)
- **Issue #4:** Weekly report generator (one-click status updates)

Each issue builds on the last. Miss one? No problem—they're standalone too.
