# AI Prod Weekly — Issue #20

**Subject Line:** The Friday ritual that keeps 15 projects from falling apart

---

Hey,

I manage 15 active projects right now.

Some are client work. Some are products. Some are internal systems.

Before my weekly review ritual? Chaos. Missed deadlines. Forgotten follow-ups. Projects slipping through cracks.

Now? Every Friday at 3pm, I spend 45 minutes. Everything stays on track.

This week: the AI-augmented weekly review system that keeps complexity under control.

---

## 1. THE COMPLEXITY PROBLEM

Here's what happens without a system:

- Important tasks hide in Slack threads
- Client follow-ups get lost in email
- "Next steps" from meetings vanish
- Projects stall without anyone noticing
- You wake up Sunday remembering something you forgot

Sound familiar?

The solution isn't better task management software.

It's a ritual. A weekly forcing function.

## 2. THE 45-MINUTE REVIEW FRAMEWORK

My exact Friday process:

### Phase 1: Capture (10 minutes)

**Gather all loose ends into one place.**

I use a simple prompt:

```
Review these sources for open loops:
1. This week's calendar events (paste them)
2. Starred emails (paste subjects)
3. Slack saved messages (paste them)
4. Voice memos (transcribe first)
5. Notes from meetings (paste them)

Extract every:
- Action item assigned to me
- Promise I made
- Follow-up I mentioned
- Question left unanswered
- Deadline mentioned

Output as a simple list, one item per line.
Format: [Source] - [Action/Item]
```

This alone catches 80% of what I'd otherwise forget.

### Phase 2: Categorize (10 minutes)

**Sort the chaos into buckets.**

```
Take this list of items and categorize:

[paste captured list]

Categories:
1. URGENT (deadline this week, commitment made)
2. IMPORTANT (moves projects forward, no hard deadline)
3. WAITING (blocked on someone else)
4. SOMEDAY (good ideas, not now)
5. DONE (completed but still on list)
6. DELEGATE (should be someone else's)

For WAITING items, specify who you're waiting on.
For URGENT items, specify the deadline.
```

### Phase 3: Prioritize (10 minutes)

**Decide what actually matters next week.**

```
From these URGENT and IMPORTANT items, help me plan next week:

[paste categorized list]

Constraints:
- I have [X] hours of focus time
- [Day] is meetings-heavy
- [Day] is my deep work day
- I can realistically complete [Y] significant tasks

Suggest:
1. Top 3 priorities for the week
2. What to schedule on which days
3. What to explicitly defer (with reason)
4. What to delegate or decline (with suggested message)
```

### Phase 4: Clean (10 minutes)

**Update systems and clear mental space.**

Manual work I do myself:
- Move completed tasks to done
- Update project statuses
- Archive old threads
- Clear inbox to zero (or near-zero)
- Update any shared trackers

### Phase 5: Reflect (5 minutes)

**Quick wins and lessons.**

```
Based on this week's review, answer:

1. What was my biggest win this week?
2. What almost fell through the cracks? Why?
3. What pattern am I noticing in my "forgot" items?
4. What system could prevent the pattern?

Keep each answer to one sentence.
```

This reflection compounds. After 4 weeks, patterns become obvious.

## 3. THE PROMPTS THAT MAKE IT WORK

### The Project Health Check

For each active project:

```
Project status check for [PROJECT NAME]:

Recent activity:
[paste recent notes/updates]

Answer:
1. What's the current status? (On track / At risk / Blocked / Complete)
2. What's the next milestone?
3. Is it progressing or stalled?
4. What would move it forward this week?
5. Who needs to hear from me?

Keep answers brief. Flag anything concerning.
```

I run this for each major project. Takes 2 minutes each.

### The Relationship Radar

```
Review my client/stakeholder touchpoints this week:

[paste communication log]

Flag anyone who:
- I haven't contacted in 2+ weeks
- Seems frustrated or confused
- Is waiting on something from me
- Mentioned a deadline I might have missed
- Deserves a thank you or check-in

Suggest a one-sentence reach out for each.
```

Relationships slip when you're not paying attention. This catches it.

### The Calendar Audit

```
Look at next week's calendar:

[paste calendar events]

Identify:
1. Meetings that could be emails (suggest decline message)
2. Back-to-back slots with no buffer (flag risk)
3. Missing prep time for important meetings
4. Unscheduled commitments that need slots
5. Opportunities for batching (similar tasks together)

Suggest 3 calendar changes to improve the week.
```

## 4. WHAT THE REVIEW ACTUALLY PRODUCES

By the end of 45 minutes, I have:

**A clear next-week plan:**
- Top 3 priorities (written, specific)
- Time blocks scheduled
- Prep work identified

**Updated systems:**
- All tasks in correct status
- Inbox at zero
- No orphan items

**Peace of mind:**
- Nothing forgotten
- Commitments tracked
- Projects visible

**Learning captured:**
- Patterns noticed
- Systems to build
- Mistakes to avoid

That last one is crucial. Without reflection, you repeat the same failures.

## 5. COMMON MISTAKES (THAT KILL THE HABIT)

**Mistake #1: Skipping when busy.**

Fridays are busy? That's exactly when you need the review most.

The review takes 45 minutes. Chaos takes hours.

**Mistake #2: Going too deep.**

The review is for FINDING issues, not solving them.

"This project is at risk" is enough. You don't need to fix it during the review.

**Mistake #3: No capture system.**

If you don't save open loops throughout the week, the review captures nothing.

I star emails. Save Slack messages. Voice memo random thoughts.

**Mistake #4: Perfectionism.**

A quick review beats no review.

If you only have 20 minutes, do 20 minutes. Still valuable.

**Mistake #5: Sunday night anxiety.**

If you're still stressed about work on Sunday, the review didn't work.

The point is to leave Friday with everything externalized. Brain empty. Systems full.

## 6. THE AUTOMATION LAYER

**My weekly review automation:**

**Trigger:** Friday 2:45pm

**Automated prep:**
1. Pull this week's calendar events into a doc
2. Pull starred emails (subjects + senders)
3. Pull Slack saved items
4. Pull tasks due next week
5. Compile into "Weekly Review Source" document

**My role:** Open the doc at 3pm. Run the prompts. Do the thinking.

**Post-review automation:**
1. Send summary to myself (for reference)
2. Schedule next week's focus blocks
3. Send any "reach out" messages I decided on

---

## 7. THE SCALING SECRET

When you have 5 projects, a weekly review is nice.

When you have 15 projects, it's essential.

Here's what changes at scale:

**More capture, less thinking:** You can't hold 15 projects in your head. You must externalize.

**Project grouping:** I group projects by type (client work, products, internal). Review each group, not each project.

**Ruthless prioritization:** With 15 projects, you can meaningfully advance maybe 5 per week. Choose. Let others coast.

**Weekly themes:** Monday = client delivery. Tuesday = product building. Reduces context switching.

---

## THIS WEEK'S ACTION

Block 45 minutes on your calendar for Friday.

Then run this single prompt with whatever you can gather:

```
Here's everything on my mind about work right now:

[brain dump - just type everything]

Organize this into:
1. Actions I need to take (one per line)
2. Things I'm waiting on (with who)
3. Things I can let go of
4. One insight about my current workload

Be honest about what I'm overcommitting to.
```

Even a messy review beats no review.

## ONE AUTOMATION TO STEAL

**The Auto-Prep Weekly Review:**

**Trigger:** Friday 2:30pm

**Workflow:**
1. Google Calendar API → get this week's events → format as list
2. Gmail API → get starred emails → extract subjects
3. Notion/Todoist API → get tasks updated this week → format
4. Compile into single "Weekly Review Source" doc
5. Add template questions at top
6. Send Slack notification: "Weekly review doc ready"

**Your role:** Open and think. No gathering.

**Time saved:** 15 minutes per review (that's 13 hours per year).

## WHAT'S NEXT

Next week: "The Delegation Playbook" — How I use AI to delegate effectively without micromanaging (even when I don't have a team).

Until then, may your Fridays end with clarity, not chaos.

Cheers,
AI Prod Weekly

P.S. The math: A weekly review that saves 3 hours of fire-fighting per week = 156 hours per year. That's almost a month of work days.

P.P.S. Try it this Friday. Reply and tell me what you caught that would have slipped.
